# Part 3
1. Bug: the adder is concatenating the two numbers rather than summing them. The data types of the inputs (`num1` and `num2`) are strings so when they are added together, they are concatenated as strings.
2. I would fix the the bug by converting `num1` and `num2` to number types using then `Number()` function.
